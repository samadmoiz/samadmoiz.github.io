User & Organization Pages live in a special repository dedicated to GitHub Pages files. You will need to name this repository with the account name, e.g. atmos/atmos.github.io.

You must use the username.github.io naming scheme.
Content from the master branch will be used to build and publish your GitHub Pages site.
You can only use your own account name for a User or Organization Page repository. A repository like joe/bob.github.io will not build a User Pages site.

When User Pages are built, they are available at http(s)://<username>.github.io.
